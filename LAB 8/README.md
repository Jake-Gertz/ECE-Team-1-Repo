### Summary Answers

In this lab we learned about the functions and use cases of multiplexers and demultiplexers. We learned how to use them to our advantage when creating logic on a circuit board. Using buttons and switches, we can create logic that filters multiple inputs into multiple seperate outputs.

## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.

The function of a multiplexer is to filter multiple inputs into one single output. This is so you can send multiple input signals into a single channel and have them fill the same purpose. This allows you to route the data into a smaller signal, making it simpler and more effiecient.

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.

The function of a demultiplexer is to branch a single input into multiple outputs. The goal is to make the circuit more complex, and have more potential outputs. This takes the circuit from being less complex to being more complex, to potentially broaden the circuit and its uses.

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannon’s)

A multiplexer could be used to simplify a circuit, and to make it less confusing. For example, you could use a multiplexer to take somewhat redundant inputs and combine them into a single output that fulfills the same purpose. If the route you took didn't necessarily matter because they all go to the same place in around the same time, those routes could all be combined into a single output that is simply the destination and you can decide on which route you prefer.
